**Definations:**

* Convolution  
Operation performed on the image to get a new image. Ex convolving a 3x3 matrix on 5x5 matrix i.e converting a 5x5 matrix to 3x3 by performing operaitons like matrix multiplication the product matrix would be the new matrix (resolution of an image).

* Filters/Kernels  
Kernals are also known as masks, channels, convolutions which are used to extract some particular feature from the avaliable matrix for a particular result. 

* Epochs  
Epochs is the measure of number of times the model would be trained.

* 1x1 Convolution  
It is a filter/mask/convulation of size 1x1 which would convolve nxn into 1x1. It would reduce the z-dimension so that the processing would be eazy without affecting x and y dimensions.

* 3x3 Convolution  
It is a filter/mask/convulation of size 3x3. Ex when 3x3 is convloved on 5x5 the resultant matrix would be 3x3 matrix. It reduces the matrix elements for 25 to 9

* Feature Maps  
Feature map is the result of the convloution applied to the image matrix.

* Activation Function  
Activation functions is the function which decides matrix obtained in feature map is right or wrong

* Receptive Field  
It is the part of the image in specific that the Convolutions are looking.
